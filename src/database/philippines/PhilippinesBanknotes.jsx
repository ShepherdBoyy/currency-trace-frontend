    moneyDescription:
      "Colored light-blue, the main designs on the front of the note feature the trio portraits of José Abad Santos, Vicente Lim and Josefa Llanes Escoda. Also on the front of the note is an image of the Centennial celebration of Philippine independence. The main designs on the back of the note feature the Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park, the South Sea Pearl (Pinctada maxima), and a cloth design from the Mindanao design for T'nalak (Ikat-dyed abaca). The original issue from 2010 to 2017 featured the Order of Lakandula (erroneously labelled as 'Medal of Honor') and its description on the front. Notes issued from 2017 onwards omit both the medal and its description. This April 2022, the BSP in partnership with the Reserve Bank of Australia, will release a limited trial polymer version of the 1000-piso banknote, completely removing the three portraits of the figureheads and instead replacing it with an image of the Philippine Eagle with a clear window of Sampaguita, the national flower of the Philippines. The banknote is also the first to be printed which features the 2020 logo of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, which has received much criticism from the general public. In an interview, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Benjamin Diokno stated that 'The new series will focus on fauna and flora in the Philippines.'",
